# PDSA Game Suite — Minimum Cost Assignment

BSc (Hons) Computing · PDSA Module · Batch 24.2  
**National Institute of Business Management — School of Computing and Engineering**

## Overview

A web-based game that solves the **Assignment Problem**: optimally assigning N employees to N tasks to minimise total cost.  
Each game round generates a random N (50–100) and a random cost matrix ($20–$200 per cell).  
Two algorithms are compared side-by-side with execution times recorded in a database.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Complexity | Optimal? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Greedy** | O(n²) | No — heuristic |
| **Hungarian (Kuhn-Munkres)** | O(n³) | Yes — guaranteed global optimum |

**Greedy:** For each employee in order, assign the cheapest unassigned task.  
**Hungarian:** Row/column reduction + König's theorem minimum line cover to find the true optimum.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- Node.js 18+

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies and create virtualenv automatically
uv sync

# Start server
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
# Runs at http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs at http://localhost:5173
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest -v
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/round/new` | Generate new round (random N + cost matrix) |
| `POST` | `/api/round/solve` | Run both algorithms, save results to DB |
| `GET` | `/api/rounds` | Retrieve full game history |

---

## Game Modes

- **Auto** — both algorithms solve immediately; view results and timing
- **Manual** — assign all employees yourself using the matrix grid, then compare against algorithms
- **Mixed** — make some assignments manually, then hand the remainder to an algorithm

Players can optionally enter their name before solving; it is saved with the round along with their manual total cost. A step-by-step animation shows how each algorithm arrives at its assignment.

## Database Schema

```sql
game_rounds (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    n               INTEGER,
    player_name     TEXT,         -- optional player name
    user_total_cost INTEGER,      -- cost of the player's manual assignment
    created_at      DATETIME
)

algorithm_results (
    id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    round_id       INTEGER REFERENCES game_rounds(id),
    algorithm_name TEXT,          -- "Greedy" or "Hungarian"
    total_cost     INTEGER,
    time_ms        REAL
)
```
